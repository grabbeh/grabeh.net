<h3>The curious tale of the element moving on hover</h3>
</div>
<div id="textbody"><p>Things were going so smoothly. You see part of a site that may be of interest. You go to move your cursor over it and click in the hopes of being transported away to a new part of the site to satiate your curiosity.</p><p>Perhaps a multitude of emotions course through you, excitement, trepidation, anticipation, guilt. </p><p>Your cursor hits the element but for some unexplained reason the element in question moves out your way. What is going on? Why would someone do that? Is it a malicious attempt to provoke? Still, you want to see the content so you move your cursor to the element&#39;s new position accordingly.</p><p>But why would you deliberately place a hurdle, albeit a small one, in the way of accessing content? One specific example can be found on the BBC's homepage (at least in the UK), as shown below. </p><p>Basic usability principles (and common sense) would dictate that you shouldn&#39;t do something which the user isn&#39;t expecting. When the user moves their cursor over an element it&#39;s usually because they expect to be able to interact with it, usually by clicking or dragging. Moving the element breaks this natural flow.</p><p>Whilst the above observation is trite, I'd be interested to know if there was any rationale behind the BBC's decision.</p>
