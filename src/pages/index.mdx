My name's Michael, I live in London and work as a lawyer for [Zopa](https://zopa.com). In my spare time I make silly things and serious things using substandard javascript, discarded nuts and bolts, and sticky back plastic.

Ok, I don't always make the thing. Sometimes I have an idea for the thing and sometimes I even start work on the thing, but I definitely don't always finish the thing.

## Stuff I've worked on
