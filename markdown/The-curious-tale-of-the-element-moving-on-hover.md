Things were going so smoothly. You see part of a site that may be of interest. You go to move your cursor over it and click in the hopes of being transported away to a new part of the site to satiate your curiosity.

Perhaps a multitude of emotions course through you, excitement, trepidation, anticipation, guilt.

Your cursor hits the element but for some unexplained reason the element in question moves out your way. What is going on? Why would someone do that? Is it a malicious attempt to provoke? Still, you want to see the content so you move your cursor to the element's new position accordingly.

But why would you deliberately place a hurdle, albeit a small one, in the way of accessing content? One specific example can be found on the BBC's homepage (at least in the UK), as shown below.

Basic usability principles (and common sense) would dictate that you shouldn't do something which the user isn't expecting. When the user moves their cursor over an element it's usually because they expect to be able to interact with it, usually by clicking or dragging. Moving the element breaks this natural flow.

Whilst the above observation is trite, I'd be interested to know if there was any rationale behind the BBC's decision.
